# Howdy!

> This GitHub is for my own personal use, whether it be for personal projects, school stuff, and other things in a similar vein.

Please feel free to let me know your thoughts on anything I have here, 
I'm always interested in learning more and hearing what people might think about certain things!


I have interests in all sorts of things, mostly related to Computer Science-y sort of stuff.
If anyone would like some help with anything, feel free to let me know, as I'm always keeping an
eye out for any kind of opportunity to learn something or help someone with just about anything
in the realm of Computer Science (or just science in general, ie. physics, chemistry, etc.).
(I may be a bit of a nerd)

I'd also like to put a disclaimer here to recognize that a lot (probably most) of the projects I have
here on GitHub are unfinished for one reason or another; some of them, I just moved on from, and others,
I may have lost any reason to continue with it (for the time being, at least). Whether I moved on to 
something else or have grown busy with other things, I'm still interested in hearing what anyone may
have to say, especially if it's ideas regarding any project in particular that may help move it forward.
Feel free to let me know if you would like to do/know anything with/about anything on here--I'd be happy to help!
